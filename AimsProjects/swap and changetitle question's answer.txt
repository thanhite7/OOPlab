Q1:
The title of these two objects still remains because Java is a pass-by-value language.That means when you pass a variable into a method, you are passing a copy of the variable's value, not the original reference.

Q2:
After the call of changetitle method, the title of the jungleDVD object is changed because the changetitle method directly modifies the title attribute of the jungleDVD object.Both the original reference and the copy point to the same object in memory. This means that any changes made to the objectâ€™s attributes within the method will affect the original object outside of the method. In this case, the changeTitle method receives a copy of the reference to the jungleDVD object and uses it to directly modify the title attribute of the object.


Rewirte swap method :

		String tmp2 = o2.getTitle();
		o1.setTitle(tmp2);
		o2.setTitle(tmp1);
	}
