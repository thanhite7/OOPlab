14.	Update the Aims class
The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are called. What happens when you 
donâ€™t update for them to catch?
If this update is not implemented, an error will occur stating that the exception is not handled. Consequently, not only will 
the Media class stop functioning, but other classes that rely on the .play() method will also be affected by this error.
