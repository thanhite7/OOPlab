Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
No, if we create two different contstructor methods to build DVD information, one built by title, and one built by category, it will be impossible in Java.
